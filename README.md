- 👋 Hi, I’m @iCryptologists on here & @icryptologist on Twitter. It's been quite awhile since I've been back on here due to REAL Life along with being married with a teenage son.😅😅 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about WEB3/Blockchain/Crypto/ENS!
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn something NEW on a daily basis one way or another.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can be of some assistance for, such as, crypto, nft, and ENS.
- 📫 You can reach me by Following me on Twitter @icryptologist and by Tweeting at me. If it's important, DM Me! Thanks🙏🏼in advance!
